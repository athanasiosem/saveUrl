Install instructions:

1. Create a mysql database called 'saveurl' with user 'saveurl' and password 'saveurl'.
2. Those details are already inserted in database config file. Also in saveurl\public\server_side\server_processing.php. These are the two locations you need to put the database details for the program to work.
3. Create a user at saveurl/public/auth/register and login with this user details. NOTE: the app is not multi user yet ! The same data exists for all users!
4. Have fun and send me comments or contribute to the project.
